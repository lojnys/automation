# Automation

## Description 
 This project is for automating communication for my work. As an online TA in Reading Town, private educational institute, I always send a report in a certain format to the teacher. I figured that this was repetitive and could be improved by implemening a automation. Also, I found that I could automatically send zoom links to my students. 
 I will be using the request module and use api of Kakaotalk and Gmail. Kakaotalk is a communiacation platform that is popular in Korea.
